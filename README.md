# datafun_05_sql
This project focuses on building and managing a relational database using Python and SQL, with SQLite as the database management system. The project will utilize Python to create, manage, and interact with the database and its tables, leveraging SQL for querying and manipulating relational data. 


## Setup Steps

- Created a new repository on GitHub
- Cloned the repository to VS Code using `git clone`
- Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- Added a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies
- Installed and upgraded pip, setuptools, and wheel with: `py -m pip install --upgrade pip    setuptools wheel`
- Installed project dependencies with: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Created a `README.md` file for documentation
- Set up a virtual environment with `py -m venv .venv`
- Activated the virtual environment with `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate`

## Common Git Commands

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Update README"
git push
This setup provides a clean starting point for developing Python scripts and managing dependencies for database projects.
